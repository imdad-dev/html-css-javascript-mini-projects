# My First Web Development Journey 🌱

Hi there! I'm **Imdadul Hoque** from Assam👋

This repository is very special to me — it's where I keep **all my  first time projects** when I started learning web development in 2025.

If you're a complete beginner like I was, I hope seeing my progress motivates you.  
**You don't need to be perfect from day one — just start.**

## Why I Created This Repo

- To track my own growth 📈
- To look back in the future and smile at how far I've come 😄
- To maybe inspire **one person** who feels "I'm too late" or "everyone else is better"
- To remind myself: **small consistent steps really do add up**

 
## Projects

### 01. Personal Portfolio

My very first webpage — a simple personal portfolio.

**What it shows**  
- Basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, links, images)  
- Simple CSS styling (colors, fonts, centering, margins)  
- A little bit of responsive design (media queries for mobile)

**Skills used**  
- HTML5 semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)  
- CSS basics (flexbox for layout, colors)
